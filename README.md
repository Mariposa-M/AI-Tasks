# AI Introduction Assignment

## Description

### Week 1 Assignment: Build a Cryptocurrency Advisor Chatbot

Theme: "Your First AI-Powered Financial Sidekick!"

#### Objective

Create a rule-based chatbot that analyzes cryptocurrency data and provides investment advice based on profitability (e.g., price trends) and sustainability (e.g., energy efficiency, project viability).

#### What You’ll Learn

- Basics of AI-driven decision-making.
- How to design conversational logic.
- Simple data analysis for crypto trends.

#### Tools & Resources

- Language: Python .

- Libraries: Use if-else logic or ChatterBot (optional) for conversation flow.

- Data: Predefined crypto datasets (provided below).
- Platform: Code in Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

- Design the Chatbot’s Personality

- Name your bot (e.g., CryptoBuddy).

- Define its tone: Friendly, professional, or meme-loving? (e.g., “Hey there! Let’s find you a green and growing crypto!”).

- Predefined Crypto Data

Use this sample dataset (or create your own):

```crypto_db = {
    "Bitcoin": {
        "price_trend": "rising",
        "market_cap": "high",
        "energy_use": "high",
        "sustainability_score": 3/10
    },
    "Ethereum": {
        "price_trend": "stable",
        "market_cap": "high",
        "energy_use": "medium",
        "sustainability_score": 6/10
    },
    "Cardano": {
        "price_trend": "rising",
        "market_cap": "medium",
        "energy_use": "low",
        "sustainability_score": 8/10
    }
}
```

#### 3. Chatbot Logic

- User Inputs: Ask questions like:

“Which crypto is trending up?”

“What’s the most sustainable coin?”

#### Bot Responses:

Use if-else logic to match queries to data.

#### Example:

```
if "sustainable" in user_query:
    recommend = max(crypto_db, key=lambda x: crypto_db[x]["sustainability_score"])
    print(f"Invest in {recommend}!  It’s eco-friendly and has long-term potential!")
```

#### Add Advice Rules

Profitability: Prioritize coins with price_trend = "rising" and market_cap = "high".

Sustainability: Prioritize coins with energy_use = "low" and sustainability_score > 7/10.

#### Test Your Bot
#### Sample conversation:

You: Which crypto should I buy for long-term growth?  
CryptoBuddy: Cardano (ADA) is trending up and has a top-tier sustainability score!

#### Stretch Goals
- API Integration: Pull real-time data using CoinGecko’s free API.
- NLP: Use NLTK to handle more natural language queries.
- Ethics Alert: Add a disclaimer like “Crypto is risky—always do your own research!”
